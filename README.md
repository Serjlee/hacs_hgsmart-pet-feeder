# HGSmart Pet Feeder Integration for Home Assistant

A custom Home Assistant integration for Honey Guardian/Guaridan/Guaridian S25T Pet Feeder, providing a replacement for the (horrid) HGSmart app.

This integration was developed through reverse engineering of the HGSmart Android application and provides access to feeding schedules, manual feeding, food level monitoring, and device status.

## Features

- Manual feeding button with configurable portions
- Access to the programmable feeding schedules of the device

## Questions

### Is this vibe-coded?

Quite a bit, yes. I'm sorry about that, but I have little expertise with Python and HASS API. Most of my work was reverse-engineer the API from the Flutter-based Android app and review the code Claude wrote.

### How does the authentication works?

HG APIs are authenticated via a OAuth2-looking protocol: username+password are exchanged once for an access token and refresh token, and whenever the access token expires, the refresh token is used to get a new one. 

Note that the password is not stored, so you might have to re-authenticate once in a long while. Not sure when, as my refresh token is yet to expire (if ever).

### Can I trust this integration?

As much as you can trust any random repository on the internet, I guess. I wrote it for me, and it works fine. I swear don't care about stealing your credentials and feeding your cats when you are not looking.
